local-llama-infernece-claude-instructions.txt


Following up, go through thoroughly the git cloned projects llama.cpp written in C++ and nvidia's nccl written in Cuda C++ in the local directory /media/waqasm86/External1/Project-Nvidia-Office/Project-LlamaInference/. I have created a folder Local-Llama-Inference in the local directory /media/waqasm86/External1/Project-Nvidia-Office/Project-LlamaInference/. I want to create Local-Llama-Inference as a new python project with python sdk local-llama-inference. The objective of local-llama-inference is to create a python sdk with 100% built-in integration of all the apis, code, scripts and everything else in llama.cpp and nvidia's nccl for end users who want to run llama.cpp gguf llm models in single nvidia gpu or multiple nvidia gpus system. llama.cpp offers to run only one llama-server with one gguf llm model loaded in nvidia gpus. llama.cpp also supports tensor-split for distributing models across multiple GPUs, particularly for local systems. In llama.cpp, --tensor-split is a command-line argument used for configuring how a model's computations are distributed across multiple GPUs. Go through the github repos of llama.cpp and nvidia's nccl for more information.

https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp
https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl


Note: There is a project llama-cpp-python which gives access to write llama.cpp commands and code in python but this project has been halted since August 2025. I have also git cloned this project in the local directory /media/waqasm86/External1/Project-Nvidia-Office/Project-LlamaInference/. Do not use llama-cpp-python project in my local-llama-inference python sdk. I want to keep local-llama-inference dependent on llama.cpp and nccl raw projects only. Use llama-cpp-python project for reference. 

Note: Create git ignore file for local-llama-inference to avoid uploading large files to github. Run git commands accordingly. Do not git push my project. You have to create a complete binaries tar file to cover llamatelemetry python sdk, llama.cpp and nvidia's nccl. This is because the end-users may have any nvidia gpu (single or multiple) with cuda toolkit installed of any version in their system. The pip package local-llama-inference must work with nvidia gpus (with compute compatablity 5.0+) and cuda toolkit (with version 11.5+).  



*************************************************************************************************************************

Following up, I have created a github repo https://github.com/Local-Llama-Inference/Local-Llama-Inference/ for Local-Llama-Inference python sdk. Check the given link. Next, make sure that git ignore file does not upload large files in the main page of github repo . Files more than 100 mb should not be uploaded to the main page of github repo. Next, run git commands and upload my Local-Llama-Inference python project from the local directory /media/waqasm86/External1/Project-Nvidia-Office/Project-LlamaInference/Local-Llama-Inference/local-llama-inference/ to the github repo https://github.com/Local-Llama-Inference/Local-Llama-Inference/ .


*************************************************************************************************************************

Creating a statically linked CUDA application and packaging it as a .tar file is a classic strategy for software distribution, especially in High-Performance Computing (HPC) and research environments.

The primary benefit is portability: you are creating a "batteries-included" package that can run on a variety of Linux machines without requiring the end-user to install the specific version of the CUDA Toolkit you used.



*************************************************************************************************************************





Following up, now git push the entire project local-llama-inference to my github repo main page. Then git push or upload compressed and sha256 files        
  from the directory releases/v0.1.0 to the github releases page of local-llama-inference github repo. But first you need to create github releases for      
  local-llama-inference v0.1.0 in the github releases page.       
  
  
*************************************************************************************************************************


Following up, add the releases folder available in the local directory /media/waqasm86/External1/Project-Nvidia-Office/Project-LlamaInference/Local-Llama-Inference/local-llama-inference/releases/ to git ignore file. Next, all the compressed files and sha256 files for local-llama-inference v0.1.0 from the local directory /media/waqasm86/External1/Project-Nvidia-Office/Project-LlamaInference/Local-Llama-Inference/local-llama-inference/releases/v0.1.0/ should be uploaded to the github releases link https://github.com/Local-Llama-Inference/Local-Llama-Inference/releases/ . You have uploaded the releases folder with all the files to the main page of github repo https://github.com/Local-Llama-Inference/Local-Llama-Inference/ which is not a standard practice. 



*************************************************************************************************************************

Following up, go through the github repo https://github.com/Local-Llama-Inference/Local-Llama-Inference for local-llama-inference v0.1.0 . Then check the local-llama-inference v0.2.0 in the local directory /media/waqasm86/External1/Project-Nvidia-Office/Project-LlamaInference/Local-Llama-Inference/local-llama-inference/. Sync the gitub repo with local-llama-inference v0.1.0 project. Then go through the local-llama-inference v0.1.0 project in the local directory and understand the whole project. Then create a readme file with short and comprehensive description, guide and getting-started tutorial. Do not gut push any files. 


*************************************************************************************************************************


Following up, go through all the files in the local directory /media/waqasm86/External1/Project-Nvidia-Office/Project-LlamaInference/Local-Llama-Inference/local-llama-inference/src/. Then, go through all the files in the local directory /media/waqasm86/External1/Project-Nvidia-Office/Project-LlamaInference/Local-Llama-Inference/local-llama-inference/binaries/. There are some files needed by python scripts in src folder but other files with format .a, .dll, .so , .elf(executable) , etc. should be in the local directory /media/waqasm86/External1/Project-Nvidia-Office/Project-LlamaInference/Local-Llama-Inference/local-llama-inference/releases/v0.1.0/. 


*************************************************************************************************************************



Following up, check the scripting files in the local directory /media/waqasm86/External1/Project-Nvidia-Office/Project-LlamaInference/Local-Llama-Inference/local-llama-inference/binaries/ and move those files to src folder if needed by the python scripts in src folder. 



*************************************************************************************************************************

Following up, check the the files inside the folders nccl-local-gpu and llama.cpp-local-gpu in the local directory /media/waqasm86/External1/Project-Nvidia-Office/Project-LlamaInference/Local-Llama-Inference/ are needed by local-llama-inference v0.2.0 pythn project. If not, move these folders to /media/waqasm86/External1/Project-Nvidia-Office/Project-LlamaInference/llama.cpp-nccl-samples/


*************************************************************************************************************************


Following up, now go through all the files in all the folders in my local-llama-inference v0.1.0 project in the local directory /media/waqasm86/External1/Project-Nvidia-Office/Project-LlamaInference/Local-Llama-Inference/. Add all those file to git ignore file which are not coding files, scripting files or programming files. Individual files which are large in size like binary files like .a, .dll, .so, etc. should be added to git ignore file. Do not add files with format .py, .c, .cpp, .cu, .sh and any other programming, coding or scripting files should not be added to git ignore file. Once all is done, next update the git ignore file. Run git commands and git push the necessary files and folders to the main page of the github repo https://github.com/Local-Llama-Inference/Local-Llama-Inference/


*************************************************************************************************************************

Following up, I do not want the end user to go thorugh the trouble of installing local-llama-inference v0.1.0 python sdk the following way.
tar -xzf local-llama-inference-complete-v0.1.0.tar.gz
cd local-llama-inference-v0.1.0
pip install -e ./python


I want to have "pip install local-llama-inference" to take place from my huggingface account with huggingface cdns which are fast to download and install. 

The following are my hugginface link.
https://huggingface.co/waqasm86

I have created Local-Llama-Inference project in my huggingface account with this link https://huggingface.co/datasets/waqasm86/Local-Llama-Inference/ .
Now go through my local-llama-inference v0.1.0 project in the local directory /media/waqasm86/External1/Project-Nvidia-Office/Project-LlamaInference/Local-Llama-Inference/. Next, look for what small and large files should be uploaded to https://huggingface.co/datasets/waqasm86/Local-Llama-Inference/ and then upload those files. 



*************************************************************************************************************************


Following up, go through the my project links.
https://github.com/Local-Llama-Inference/Local-Llama-Inference/
https://github.com/Local-Llama-Inference/Local-Llama-Inference/releases/
https://huggingface.co/datasets/waqasm86/Local-Llama-Inference/

Then go thorugh local-llama-inference v0.1.0 python project in the local directory /media/waqasm86/External1/Project-Nvidia-Office/Project-LlamaInference/Local-Llama-Inference/. Then create a new "pip install local-llama-inference" command which should download and install the entire pip package including cuda binaires from the huggingface link https://huggingface.co/datasets/waqasm86/Local-Llama-Inference/. 

Next, modify my readme file and add the new pip install command instructions for local-llama-inference v0.1.0. 

   
*************************************************************************************************************************


Following up, make my pip package local-llama-inference public through my hugginface account. Check my other python project llcuda in the following links  for reference. 
https://github.com/llcuda/llcuda/
https://github.com/llcuda/llcuda/releases/
https://huggingface.co/waqasm86/llcuda-binaries/
https://huggingface.co/waqasm86/llcuda/
https://huggingface.co/waqasm86/llcuda-models


The github releases link https://github.com/llcuda/llcuda/releases/ shows the download of llcuda python sdk from my huggingface account with the following command.  
pip install git+https://github.com/llcuda/llcuda.git@v2.2.0

 

*************************************************************************************************************************

Following up, go thorugh the python project in the local directory /media/waqasm86/External1/Project-Nvidia-Office/Project-LlamaInference/Local-Llama-Inference/ as well as the given links. 

https://github.com/Local-Llama-Inference/Local-Llama-Inference/
https://github.com/Local-Llama-Inference/Local-Llama-Inference/releases/
https://huggingface.co/datasets/waqasm86/Local-Llama-Inference/


Then update, modify and/or re-create the readme file for local-llama-inference v0.1.0 python sdk and then git push the project Local-Llama-Inference to my github https://github.com/Local-Llama-Inference/Local-Llama-Inference/ 






*************************************************************************************************************************

Following up, I tried to install local-llama-inference pip package in my local system xubuntu 22 linxu terminal the following way but i am not sure whether it has pip installed the complete local-llama-inference pip package from github including tar  binaries. Infact, you have removed the large cuda tar binaries https://github.com/Local-Llama-Inference/Local-Llama-Inference/releases/ which is not what I want. 

Fix the issues in the local directory /media/waqasm86/External1/Project-Nvidia-Office/Project-LlamaInference/Local-Llama-Inference/local-llama-inference/.
I do not want to install local-llama-inference complete pip package from the local directory. This defeats the purpose of building python sdk.

Following up, I tried to run jupyter notebook 02 in my local system xubuntu 22 via jupyterlab. My nvidia geforce 940m gpu has compute compatability 5.0 and 1 gb vram. So, I tried to run the gguf llm model of my own choice gemma-3-1b-it with limits but failed.

Check the first three steps Step 1, 2 and 3 in jupyter notebook 02_streaming_responses in the local directory /media/waqasm86/External1/Project-Nvidia-Office/Jupyter-Notebooks/local-llama-inference-notebooks/. Fix the issues in local-llama-inference v0.2.0 python sdk in /media/waqasm86/External1/Project-Nvidia-Office/Project-LlamaInference/Local-Llama-Inference/. Then, update, git ignore file, run git commands and git push the project to my gihub repo local-llama-inference.
